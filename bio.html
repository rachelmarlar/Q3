			<p><h2> About Me </h2></p>
				<p> My name is Rachel Margaret Marlar. I was born on October 15, 2002 and am now almost 18 yeears old. I live right on the line between Greenville coounty and Laurens county. I live with my mom, dad, younger brother, and my oldest brother who is now living in college at Clemson. I am a senior at St. Joes and I play soccer for the school as well as for my club team. I have many friends at this school and friends from outside from sports teams etc. I have lived in South Carolina my whole life. I have gone to St. Joes since 6th grade and before that I went to Prince of Peace. I used to play volleyball until I broke my collar bone and had to quit. Fun fact Ive only been out of the country one time of a school trip to Spain and France.</p>

			<p><h2> 5 Years From Now...</h2></p>
				<p> In 5 years from now I would be in my graduating year at NAU. I would be recieving my baclehors in either physical therapy or psychology. I would just be getting started to continue my education to get a masters degree. I would have boughten a small house or apartment in the Flagstaff mountains. My family all lives up in Arizona so I would see them all the time. My best friend from Arizona would be in her early 30s and teachintg at a music school while still taking time to hangout with me. I would hope I have a steady relationship at this time so I can start planning for the future. I woud have made many close friends at college but not at first because I would know no one going into it. I would have a college job either at the bookstore or waiting tables just so I can make a little extra money to spend on food and clothes. I would be very into workout routines and eating healthy and my roomate would too.</p>
